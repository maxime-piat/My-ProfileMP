        <h1>My Hobbies</h1>
        <p>A Toulousan at heart and passionate about an active life, I find my balance between sport, finance and rugby. Stade Toulousain is much more than a team to me, it's a real local pride that feeds my passion for this team sport.
            At the same time, the world of finance inspires me, combining rigour and strategy, just as it does on the pitch. I'm always looking to push myself, whether it's through physical activity or exploring new opportunities in my chosen felds, and I cultivate a dynamic spirit that's true to the values of my pink city</p>

        <h1>My Passions</h1>
        <p>As a Toulousan attached to my city and its values. I draw my energy from sport, finance and personal develonment. Fascinated by the idea of always progressing, I enjoy a good Stade Toulousain match as much as a moment of reflection to grow internally. Personal development gives me the tools to better understand, evolve and take on new challenges, a state of mind that I also find in sport and financial discipline. These passions, at the crossroads of effort and reflection, reflect my constant desire to surpass myself and embrace life to the full</p>

        <h1>My Projects</h1>
        <p>A native of Toulouse with a passion for sport, finance and personal development. I set myself goals that match my ambitions. Inspired by excellence and surpassing myself, my plan is to build a solid and fulfilling career in an investment fund in London. This city is a symbol of dynamism and opportunity in the financial sector, represents for me a professional culmination where I will be able to combine my passion for strategy, analysis and innovation. With determination and hard work, I'm ready to take up this challenge and write the next chapter of my career in the British capital</p>
